2. **Extract and push:**

   tar -xzf sentiflow-complete.tar.gz
   cd sentiflow
   git push -u origin main
   ```

## 🔑 Authentication Methods

If you get authentication errors:

**Option A - Use Personal Access Token:**
```bash
git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_TOKEN@github.com/ShikharVeer10/sentiflow.git
git push -u origin main
```

**Option B - Use SSH:**
```bash
git remote set-url origin git@github.com:ShikharVeer10/sentiflow.git
git push -u origin main
```

## ⚠️ Why Automated Push Failed

The bot environment cannot push to your repository because:
- ❌ No access to your GitHub credentials
- ❌ No personal access token for your account
- ❌ No SSH keys configured
- ✅ This is a **security feature** - only YOU can push to YOUR repository

---

## 📦 Available Resources

1. **Repository ready at:** `/home/runner/work/Emotio/sentiflow`
2. **Archive:** `/tmp/sentiflow-complete.tar.gz`
3. **Push script:** `/tmp/PUSH_COMMANDS.sh`

## ✅ After Successful Push

Visit https://github.com/ShikharVeer10/sentiflow to verify:
- README displays
- src/ folder with 12 files
- All documentation files visible

## 🆘 Still Need Help?

The issue is **only authentication**. The repository is ready - you just need to:

1. Be authenticated with GitHub (via token or SSH)
2. Run `git push`

That's it! Everything else is done.
